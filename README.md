# FoundIT

## Overview

FoundIT is a sophisticated Android application that addresses the challenge of keeping pets or valuable items within the owner's reach. The solution involves the development of a versatile collar or keychain equipped with an integrated distance detection system and wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth and GPS. This ensures timely alerts for pet owners whenever their animals venture beyond predefined distances.
